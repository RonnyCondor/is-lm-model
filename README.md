# is-lm-model
The IS-LM model developed by Hicks and Hansen is probably the most popular model of introductory macroeconomic class. Although extensive literature shows this model as the core of the Keynesian theory, it is important to recognize that Keynes has never developed this model in his main book: "The general theory of employment, interest and money" published in 1936. The IS-LM model shows how the real market interacts with the money market. Teaching this simple macroeconomic model in an illustrative way is the main purpose of this project.
